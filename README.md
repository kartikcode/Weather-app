# Weather-app
This is a mobile application built on the Kivy platform.<br> 
 Here are some capabilities I want to cover in this project:<br>
 • Render weather for multiple locations, with a selector to switch between them.<br>
 • Store the list of locations between App invocations so they don’t have to be searched again.<br>
 • Switch between current conditions and long-term forecast.<br>
 • Include settings for users to choose metric or imperial units.<br> 
 • Incorporate gestures for users to switch between screens.<br>
